Welcome to my site. Having practiced woodworking for 26 years, working exclusively with northwest hardwoods and local northwest sawyers such as Rod Jacobs, I have learned that developing relationships with those that work directly in the forest is a key component to maintaining the wholeness of the raw material and is integral to the creative process.

The most important relationships are those I have with the forest directly.  My 25 year relationship with sawyer Rod Jacobs is a great example of this. Rod has a special knack for selecting beautiful logs from the forest; doing so with respect to the trees, the loggers, and the land owners.

The richness of my career and the depth of knowledge of my understanding of wood is directly related to the care I have taken in developing these relationships. My understanding of those of us who choose to make things, to be truly inspired, creating things of value, is we must dedicate ourselves to the specific skills required by our chosen discipline and also to understanding the materials we work with and the people who help bring these materials to us. This degree of respect toward the people and the raw materials by the craftsman can help to change the industry’s attitude toward the forest; from being seen as a commodity to being seen as the living resource it is. The forest is the fundamental component of a complex web of events that requires us and the natural environment to work in harmony.

So, welcome to **Scott Spencer Higson Woodworks**. This website will be expanding over the next few months adding sections that focus on our local sawyers, the species of trees we work with, product development, and many other intriguing topics
